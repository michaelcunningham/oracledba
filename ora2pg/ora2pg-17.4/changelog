2016 04 21 - v17.4

Errata in first release attempt.

  - Fix previous patch that does not handle blob case but just clob
  - Forgot to change back the query when EMPTY_LOB_NULL is not activated.
  - Put parenthesis around AT TIME ZONE expression

This is a maintenance release to fix several issues reported by users.
There is also some major data export speed improvement thanks to the
work of PostgreSQL Pro and a new RPM spec file provided by Devrim
Gündüz to be able to build RPM package for Ora2Pg.

There is a new configuration directive:

  - EMPTY_LOB_NULL: when enabled force empty_clob() and empty_blob()
    to be exported as NULL instead as empty string.

Here is the complete list of other changes:

  - Add EMPTY_LOB_NULL directive to force empty_clob() and empty_blob()
    to be exported as NULL instead as empty string. This might improve
    data export speed if you have lot of empty lob. Thanks to Alex
    Ignatov for the report.
  - Fix import_all.sh script to import grant and tablespace separately
    as postgres user and just after indexes and constraints creation.
  - Add parsing of tablespace from "alter table ... add constraint"
    with DDL input file. Thanks to Felipe Lavoura.
  - Remove --single-transaction in import_all.sh script with TABLESPACE
    import. Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
  - Fix Makefile.PL to used with latest spec file from Devrim Gündüz
    and following the advice of calbiston.
  - Update spec file to v17.4 and latest change to Makefile.PL

    is a RPM build. Thanks to calbiston for the report.
  - Return empty bytea when a LOB is empty and not NULL.
  - Regular expressions and conditions checks improvement in method
    format_data_type() to make it a bit faster on huge tables. Thanks
    to Svetlana Shorina for the patch.
  - Fix INSERT using on the fly data import with boolean values.
    Thanks to jecuendet for the report.

This is a maintenance release to fix several issues reported in new
TEST action. There is also some feature improvement:

  * Add OPTIONS (key 'true') on table FDW export when a column is
    detected as a primary key.
  * Add DELETE configuration directive that allow a similar feature
    than the WHERE clause to replace TRUNCATE call by a "DELETE FROM
    table WHERE condition". This feature can be useful with regular
    "updates". Thanks to Sebastien Albert for the feature request.

2015 11 30 - v16.1

This release fixes several issues and adds some very useful features:

    * Generate automatically a new import_all.sh shell script when using option
      --init_project to help automate all import into PostgreSQL.

	See sh import_all.sh -? for more information.

    * Export Oracle bitmap index as PostgreSQL btree_gin index. This require the
      btree_gin extension and PostgreSQL >= 9.4. This is the default.

    * Auto set DEFINED_PK to the first column of a table that have a unique key
      defined that is a NUMBER. This allow data of any table with a numeric
      unique key to be extracted using multiple connexions to Oracle using -J
      option. Tables with no numeric unique key will be exported with a single
      process.

    * Improve BLOB export speed by using hex encoding instead of escape. This
      might speed up be BLOB export by 10.

    * Allow use of LOB locator to retrieve BLOB and CLOB data to prevent having
      to set LONGREADLEN. Now LONGREADLEN is set to 8KB. Old behavior using
      LONGREADLEN can still be enabled by setting NO_LOB_LOCATOR to 0, given
      for backward compatibility. Default is to use LOB locator.

    * Ora2Pg will also auto detect table with BLOB and automatically decrease
      DATA_LIMIT to a value lower or equal to 1000. This is to prevent OOM.

    * Improving indexes and constraints creation speed by using the LOAD action
      and a file containing SQL orders to perform. It is possible to dispatch
      those orders over multiple PostgreSQL connections. To be able to use this
      feature, PG_DSN, PG_USER and PG_PWD must be set. Then:

	ora2pg -t LOAD -c config/ora2pg.conf -i schema/tables/INDEXES_table.sql -j 4
    
      will dispatch indexes creation over 4 simultaneous PostgreSQL connections.
    
      This will considerably accelerate this part of the migration process with
      huge data size.

    * Domain indexes are now exported as b-tree but commented to let you know
      where possible FTS are required.

    * Add number of refresh ON COMMIT materialized view in detailed report.

    * Allow redefinition of numeric type, ex: NUMBER(3)::bigint to fix wrong
      original definition in Oracle.

    * Allow export of all schemas from an Oracle Instance when SCHEMA directive
      is empty and EXPORT_SCHEMA is enabled. All exported objects will be
      prefixed with the name of their original Oracle schema or search_path will
      be set to that schema name. Thanks to Magnus Hagander for the feature
      request.
 
    * Allow use of COPY FREEZE to export data when COPY_FREEZE is enabled. This
      will only works with export to file and when -J or ORACLE_COPIES is not
      set or default to 1. It can be used with direct import into PostgreSQL
      under the same condition but -j or JOBS must be unset or default to 1.
      Thanks to Magnus Hagander for the feature request.

Some new configuration directives:
 
    * BITMAP_AS_GIN: enable it to use btree_gin extension to create bitmap
      like index with pg >= 9.4. You will need to create the extension by
      yourself: "create extension btree_gin;". Default is to create GIN index,
      when disabled, a btree index will be created.
    * NO_LOB_LOCATOR: to disable use of LOB locator and extract BLOB "inline"
      using a less or more high value in LONGREADLEN.
    * BLOB_LIMIT: to force the value of DATA_LIMIT for tables with BLOB. Default
      is to automatically set this limit using the following code:
	BLOB_LIMIT=DATA_LIMIT; while (BLOB_LIMIT > 1000) BLOB_LIMIT /= 10
    * COPY_FREEZE: use it to use COPY FREEZE instead of simple COPY to speedup
      import into PostgreSQL.

Here is the complete list of other changes:

  - Limite package function name rewrite to call with parenthesis after the
    function name to avoid rewriting names of other objects.
  - Fix extra replacement of function name with package prefix. On some
    condition it was done multiple time.
  - Set REPLACE_ZERO_DATE to -INFINITY in generic configuration when --mysql
    is enabled.
  - Fix extraction of partition with MySQL that was not limited to a single
    database.
  - Do some replacement on ORACLE_DNS and SCHEMA into generic configuration
    when --mysql is used for better understanding.
  - Add call to round() on -J parallelization when the auto detected column
    is a numeric with scale.
  - Add COMMIT to the difficulties migration assessment keywords as it need
    context analyzing.
  - Add call to cursor's %ROWCOUNT, %ISOPEN and %NOTFOUND to difficulties
    migration assessment keywords.
  - Replace call to CURSOR%ROWTYPE by RECORD. Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
    report.

  - Disable variable NO_LOB_LOCATOR and set LONGREADLEN to 8192 bytes to use
    LOB locators to extract BLOB in generic configuration file.

    to Stephane Tachoires for the report.
  - Exclude from export objects name matching /.*\$JAVA\$.*/ and /^PROF\$.*/.
  - Fix migration assessment report when created during the package export.
  - Force writing Oracle package body in separate files when FILE_PER_FUNCTION
    is enabled and PLSQL_PGSQL disable to obtain package source code.
  - Fix case where sequence max value is lower than start value, in this case,
    set max value = start value.
  - Fix missing newline after each package file to import in global package.sql
    file when FILE_PER_FUNCTION is enabled.
  - Remove export of user PUBLIC in GRANT export.
  - Set DISABLE_TRIGGERS to 1 in generic configuration file auto generated when
    ora2pg option --init_project is used.
  - Remove call to quote_reserved_words() with index column when it we detect
    a function based index, too much false positive are rewritten with SQL code
    like CASE...WHEN.
  - Update export_schema.sh to remove .sql files when there is not such object
    leaving export directory empty.
  - Prevent creating TBSP_INDEXES_tablespace.sql when no tablespaces are found
  - Update documentation on WHERE clause on how to limit the number of tuples
    exported for Oracle and MySQL to test data import.
  - Fix unlisted spatial indexes in assessment report.

2015 10 15 - v16.0

This major release improve PL/SQL code replacement, fixes several bugs and
adds some major new features:

  * Full migration of MySQL database, it just work like with Oracle database.
  * Full migration assessment report for MySQL database.
  * New script, ora2pg_scanner, to perform a migration assessment of all
    Oracle and MySQL instances on a network.
  * Add technical difficulty level in migration assessment.
  * Allow migration assessment on client queries extracted from AUDIT_TRAIL
    (oracle) or general_log table (mysql).
  * Ora2Pg has a "made in one night" brand new Web site (still need some work).
    See http://ora2pg.darold.net/

Example of technical difficulty level assessment output for the sakila database
with some more difficulties:

	Total	83.90 cost migration units means approximatively 1 man-day(s).
	Migration level: B-5

Here are the explanation of the migration level code:

    Migration levels:
	A - Migration that might be run automatically
	B - Migration with code rewrite and a human-days cost up to 10 days
	C - Migration with code rewrite and a human-days cost above 10 days
    Technical levels:
	1 = trivial: no stored functions and no triggers
	2 = easy: no stored functions but with triggers, no manual rewriting
	3 = simple: stored functions and/or triggers, no manual rewriting
	4 = manual: no stored functions but with triggers or views with code
	            rewriting
	5 = difficult: stored functions and/or triggers with code rewriting

This is to help you to find the database that can be migrated first with small
efforts (A and B) and those who need to conduct a full migration project (C).

This release has also some new useful features:

  * Export type SHOW_TABLE now shows additional information about table type
    (FOREIGN, EXTERNAL or PARTITIONED with the number of partition).
  * Connection's user and password can be passed through environment variables
    ORA2PG_USER and ORA2PG_PASSWD to avoid setting them at ora2pg command line.
  * Improve PL/SQL replacement on ADD_MONTH(), ADD_YEAR(), TRUNC(), INSTR() and
    remove the replacement limitation on DECODE().
  * Add detection of migration difficulties in views, was previously reserved
    to functions, procedures, packages and triggers.
  * Replace values in auto generated configuration file from command line
    options -s, -n, -u and -p when --init_project is used.
  * Adjust lot of scores following new functionalities in Ora2Pg, ex: dblink or
    synomyms are now easy to migrate.

There is some new command line options to ora2pg script:

  * -m | --mysql : to be used with --init_project and -i option to inform
    ora2pg that we work with a MySQL format
  * -T | --temp_dir : option to be able to set a distinct temporary directory
    to run ora2pg in parallel.
  * --audit_user : option to set the user used in audit filter and enable
    migration assessment report on queries from AUDIT_TRAIL (oracle) or
    general_log table (mysql).
  * --dump_as_sheet and --print_header options to be able to compute a CSV
    file with all migration assessment from a list of oracle database.
  * --dump_as_csv option to report assessments into a csv file. It will not
    include comments or details, just objects names, numbers and cost.

Backward compatibility:

  - Change NULL_EQUAL_EMPTY to be disabled by default to force change in the
    application instead of transforming the PL/SQL.

This release adds some new configuration directives:

  * MYSQL_PIPES_AS_CONCAT: Enable it if double pipe and double ampersand
    (|| and &&) should not be taken as equivalent to OR and AND.
  * MYSQL_INTERNAL_EXTRACT_FORMAT: Enable it if you want EXTRACT() replacement
    to use the internal format returned as an integer.
  * AUDIT_USER: Set the comma separated list of user name that must be used
    to filter from the DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL or general_log tables.
  * REPLACE_ZERO_DATE: "zero" date: 0000-00-00 00:00:00 it is replaced by a
    NULL by default, use it to use the date of your choice.
  * INDEXES_RENAMING: force renaming of all indexes using tablename_columnsname
    Very useful for database that have multiple time the same index name or
    that use the same name than a table.
  * HUMAN_DAYS_LIMIT: default to 5 days, used to set the number of human-days
    limit for migration of type C.

    new configuration directive HUMAN_DAYS_LIMIT (default to 5 days) to set
    the number of human-days limit for migration of type C.
  - Add MERGE with a migration cost of 3, still need work be replaced by
    ON CONFLICT.
  - Remove some redundant regular expressions.
  - Fix escaped commas not working properly in MODIFY_TYPE. A MODIFY_TYPE
    value like `TABLE1:COL4:decimal(9\,6)` was leading to a column like
    `col4 decimal(8#nosep#3)` in the SQL dump file that was generated. This
    fixes the output to be `col4 decimal(8,3)`. Thanks to Nick Muerdter for
    the patch.
  - Strip default "empty_clob()" values from table dumps. This function does
    not exist in Postgres and is not necessary. Thanks to Nick Muerdter for
    the patch.
  - Fix undesired double quoting of column name in function based indexes.
  - Fix issue with Perl < 5.8 "Modification of a read-only value attempted"
  - Fix retrieving of table size on Oracle 8i.
  - Add auto double quoting of object name with unauthorized characters.
    Thanks to Magnus Hagander for the feature request.
  - Automatically double quote object name beginning with a number
  - Fix missing DESC part in descending indexes. Thanks to Magnus Hagander
    for the report.
  - Fix case where a column name in oracle is just a number (e.g. the column
    is called "7"), it will be created in postgres without quoted identifier,
    which fails. Thanks to Magnus Hagander for the report.
  - Fix "reqs/sec" display in debug mode. Thanks to Laurent Martelli for
    the patch
  - Fix export if Oracle procedure is created without a parameter. Thanks to
    dirkgently007 for the report.
  - Fix CSV report output.
  - Fix triggers from file parser.
  - Add a test on triggers return to handle case where it is triggered on
    DELETE + other(s) event(s). In this case a test is done on the TG_OP to
    return OLD if event is DELETE or NEW in other case. Thanks to Dominique
    Legendre for the suggestion.
  - Change NULL_EQUAL_EMPTY to be disabled by default to force change of the
    application instead of transforming the PL/SQL.
  - Change score of SYNONYM and DBLINK in the migration assessment.
  - Add conversion of Oracle type STRING into varchar(n) or text.
  - Add information about libaio1 requirement for instant client
  - Remove extra space when calling ora2pg_get_efile() used to export BFILE
    into EFILE. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the export.


2015 06 01 - v15.3

This is a maintenance release only that fixes several minor bugs and typos.
The configuration file have been entirely rewritten to classify configuration
directives in section for better understanding.

Here is the full list of changes:

  - Ora2Pg will use DEFAULT_SRID when call to sdo_cs.map_oracle_srid_to_epsg()
    returns an ORA-01741 error. Mostly because there's no SRID defined for that
    column in ALL_SDO_GEOM_METADATA. The error message will still be displayed
    but a warning will explain the reason and ora2pg will continue with default
    value. Thanks to kazam for the report.
  - Add current setting for NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT and NLS_DATE_FORMAT to the
    SHOW_ENCODING report.
  - Change default value for GEOMETRY_EXTRACT_TYPE to INTERNAL instead of WKT.
  - Change generic configuration file behavior with BINMODE parameter commented
    if it was previously uncommented. This will force to use the default value.
  - Fix potential issue with max open file limit with unclosed temporary file.
    Thanks to Marc Clement for the report.
  - Fix use of SECURITY DEFINER in SYNONYM export.
  - Fix parsing of editable function/procedure/package from input DML file.
  - Fix case where variable $2 and $3 was null after a too early call of a new
    substitution in read_view_from_file(). Thanks to Alex Ignatov for the patch.
  - Add support to "create or replace editionable|noneditionable" from input DML
    files. Thanks to Alex Ignatov for the report.
  - Fix unknown column HIGH_VALUE from *_TAB_PARTITIONS in Oracle 8i. Thanks to
    Sebastian Fischer for the patch.
  - Fix call to ALL_MVIEW_LOGS object which not exists with Oracle 8i. Thanks to
    Sebastian Fischer for the report.
  - Fix Error ORA-22905 while Get the dimension of the geometry by looking at
    number of element in the SDO_DIM_ARRAY. Thanks to jkutterer for the patch.
  - Remove reordering export of view for Oracle database before 11g. Thanks to
    kyiannis for the report.
  - Fix several some typos and a bunch of misspelled. Thanks to Euler Taveira
    for all the patches.
  - Fix missing Oracle database version before looking at function security
    definer. Thanks to kyiannis for the report.

2015 04 13 - v15.2

This new minor release fixes some issues and adds two new configuration
directives:

  * ORA_INITIAL_COMMAND to be able to execute a custom command just after
    the connection to Oracle, for example to unlock a security policy.
  * INTERNAL_DATE_MAX to change the behavior of Ora2Pg with internal date
    found in user defined types.

This version will also automatically re-order exported views taking into
account interdependencies.

Here is the full list of changes:

    - Add INTERNAL_DATE_MAX configuration directive with default to 49 to be
      used when reformatting internal date returned with a user defined type
      and a timestamp column. DBD::Oracle only return the internal date format
      01-JAN-77 12.00.00.000000 AM so it is difficult to know if the year value
      must be added to 2000 or 1900. We takes the default behavior where date
      are between 1950 and 2049.
    - Remove extra CHAR and BYTE information from column type. Thanks to Magnus
      Hagander for the report.
    - Re-order views taking into account interdependencies. Thanks to Kuppusamy
      Ravindran and Ulrike for the suggestion and the Oracle query.
    - Fix case sensitivity in function based indexes. Thanks to Kuppusamy
      Ravindran for the report.
    - Fix PERFORM wrong replacement and infinite loop processing DECODE in some
      condition. Thanks to Didier Brugat for the report.
    - Fix replacement of boolean value in DEFAULT value at table creation.
      Thanks to baul87 for the report.
    - Add ORA_INITIAL_COMMAND configuration directive to be able to execute a
      custom command just after the connection to Oracle, to unlock a policy for
      example. Thanks to Didier BRUGAT for the feature request.
    - Fix alias in from clause when an XML type is found. Thanks to Lance Jacob
      for the record.
    - Invert condition on excluding temporary file with Windows OS. Thanks to
      kazam for the report.
    - Remove start time and global number of rows from _dump_table() parameters
      they are not used anymore.
    - Remove use of temporary file on Windows operating system.
    - Disable parallel table export when operating system is Windows.
    - Fix export of objects with case sensitivity using ALLOW or EXCLUDE
      directives. Thanks to Alexey Ignatov for the report.
    - Fix export of triggers from recycle bin.
    - Fix count of synonym in assessment report.
    - Add list of tables created by OEM to the exclusion list.
    - Fix look at default configuration file and set mode of export_schema.sh
      to executable by default. Thanks to Kuppusamy Ravindran for the report.
    - Add AUTHORIZATION to the list of PostgreSQL reserved word. Thanks to
      Kuppusamy Ravindran for the report.
    - Display a warning when an index has the same name as the table itself so
      that you can renamed it before export. Thanks to Kuppusamy Ravindran for
      the feature request.
    - Fix export of function based indexes with multiple column. Thanks to
      Kuppusamy Ravindran for the report.
    - Modify ora2pg script to return 0 on success, 1 on any fatal error and 2
      when a child process die is detected.
    - Change the way the generic configuration file is handle during project
      initialization. You can use -c option to copy your own into the project
      directory. If the file has the .dist extension, ora2pg will apply the
      generic configuration on it. Thanks to Kuppusamy Ravindran for the report
      and features request.
    - Add debug information when cloning the Oracle connection.
    - Force return of OLD when the trigger is on DELETE event

2015 02 06 - v15.1

New minor release just to fix two annoying bugs in previous release.

    - Fix replacement of function name which include SELECT in their name by
      PERFORM. Thanks to Frederic Bamiere for the report.
    - Fix creation of sources subdirectories when initializing a new migration project.

2015 02 04 - v15.0

This major release improve PL/SQL code replacement, fixes several bugs and
adds some new useful features:

    - Add support to the PostgreSQL external_file extension to mimic BFILE
      type from Oracle. See https://github.com/darold/external_file for
      more information.
    - Allow export of Oracle's DIRECTORY as external_file extension objects
      This will also try to export read/write privilege on those directories.
    - Allow export of Oracle's DATABASE LINK as Oracle foreign data wrapper
      server using oracle_fdw.
    - Allow function with PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION to be exported through
      a dblink wrapper to achieve the autonomous transaction.
    - Allow export of Oracle's SYNONYMS as views. Views can use foreign table
      to create "synonym" on object of a remote database.
    - Add trimming of data when DATA_TYPE is used to convert CHAR(n) Oracle
      column into varchar(n) or text. Default is to trim both side any space
      character. This behavior can be controlled using two new configuration
      directives TRIM_TYPE and TRIM_CHAR.
    - Add auto detection of geometry constraint type and dimensions through
      spatial index parameters. This avoid the overhead of sequential scan
      of the geometric column.
    - Add support to export Oracle sub partition and create sub partition
      for PostgreSQL with the corresponding trigger.
    - ALLOW and EXCLUDE directives are now able to apply filter on the object
      type. Backward compatibility can not be fully preserved, older definition
      will apply to current export type only, this could change your export in
      some conditions. See documentation update for more explanation.
    - Add PACKAGE_AS_SCHEMA directive to change default behavior that use a
      schema to emulate Oracle package function call. When disable, all calls
      to package_name.function_name() will be turn into package_name_function_name()
      just like a function call in current schema.
    - Add FKEY_OPTIONS to force foreign keys options. List of supported options
      are: ON DELETE|UPDATE CASCADE|RESTRICT|NO ACTION.
    - Add rewriting of internal functions in package body, those functions will
      be prefixed by the package name. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the
      feature request.

Some change can break backward compatibility and make configuration directives
obsolete:

    - The ALLOW_PARTITION configuration directive has been removed. With new
      extended filters in ALLOW/EXCLUDE directive, this one is obsolete.
      Backward compatibility is preserved but may be removed in the future.
    - ALLOW and EXCLUDE directives do not works as previously. Backward
      compatibility may be preserved with some export type but may be broken
      in most of them. See documentation.
    - It is recommended now to leave the NLS_LANG and CLIENT_ENCODING commented
      to let Ora2Pg handle automatically the encoding. Those directives may be
      removed in the future.

Here is the full changelog of the release:

    - Declares SYNONYM views as SECURITY DEFINER to be able to grant access to
      objects in other schema.
    - Fix wrong replacement of data type in function body. Thanks to Dominique
      Legendre for the report.
    - Fix missing column name replacement on trigger export when REPLACE_COLS
      is defined. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the report.

      column name and no values defined.
    - Allow parsing of DATABASE LINK and SYNONYM from a DDL file.
    - Add DIRECTORY export type to export all Oracle directories as entries for
      the external_file extension. This will also export read/write privilege
      on those directories. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the feature request.
    - Review documentation about NULL_EQUAL_EMPTY.
    - Fix missing code to replace IS NULL as coalesce(...). Thanks to Dominique
      Legendre for the report.
    - Add external_file schema to search_path when BFILE is set to EFILE in
      directive DATA_TYPE. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the request.
    - Remove IF EXIST clause to oracle function created by Ora2Pg for BFILE
      export. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the report.
    - Add support to the PostgreSQL external_file extension to mimic BFILE type
      from Oracle. See https://github.com/darold/external_file for more information.
    - Add auto detection of geometry constraint type and dimensions through the
      spatial index parameters first. This avoid the overhead of sequential scan
      of the geometric column.
    - Remove lookup at package function when not required.
    - Fix issue with database < 10g that do not have the DROPPED column into the
      ALL_TABLES view. Thanks to Lance Jacob for the report.
    - Add trimming of data when DATA_TYPE is used to convert CHAR(n) Oracle
      column into varchar(n) or text column into PostgreSQL. Default is to

2014 11 12 - v14.1

This is a maintenance release only mainly to add patches that was not
been applied in previous major release.

    - Remove ALLOW_CODE_BREAK, it is no more useful.
    - Change output of SHOW_ENCODING to reflect change to default encoding.
    - Comment ALLOW_PARTITION in default configuration file
    - Add QUERY and KETTLE export type in configuration file comments.

2014 11 05 - v14.0

This major release adds full export of Oracle Locator or Spatial geometries into
PostGis, SDO_GEOM functions and SDO_OPERATOR are also translated. This export
adds the following features:

  1. Basic and complex geometry types support
  2. Geometry data conversion from Oracle to PostGIS
  3. Spatial Index conversion
  4. Geometry metadata / constraints support
  5. Spatial functions conversion

For spatial data export, you have three choice, WKT to export data using
SDO_UTIL.TO_WKTGEOMETRY(), WKB to export data using SDO_UTIL.TO_WKBGEOMETRY()
and INTERNAL to export geometry using a Pure Perl library. Unlike the first
two methods, INTERNAL is fast and do not raise Out Of Memory. The export is
done in WKT format so that you can verify your geometry before importing to
PostgreSQL.

Other additional major features are:

  - Parallel table processing.
  - Auto generation of migration template with a complete project tree.
  - Allow user defined queries to extract data from Oracle.

Parallel table processing is controlled by the -P or --parallel command line
options or the PARALLEL_TABLE configuration directive to set the number of
tables that will be processed in parallel for data extraction. The limit is
the number of cores on your machine. Ora2Pg will the open one connection to
Oracle database for each parallel table extraction. This directive, when upper
than 1, will invalidate ORACLE_COPIES but not JOBS, so the real number of
process that will be used is (PARALLEL_TABLES * JOBS).

The two options --project_base and --init_project when used indicate to Ora2Pg
to create a project template with a work tree, a generic configuration file
and a shell script to export all objects from the Oracle database. So that you
just have to define the Oracle database connection into the configuration file
and then execute the shell script called export_schema.sh to export your
Oracle database into files. Here a sample of the command and the project's tree.

    ora2pg --project_base /tmp --init_project test_project

    /tmp/test_project/
	config/
		ora2pg.conf
	data/
	export_schema.sh
	reports/
	schema/
		fdws/  functions/  grants/  kettles/
		mviews/  packages/  partitions/
		procedures/  sequences/  tables/
		tablespaces/  triggers/  types/  views/
	sources/
		functions/  mviews/  packages/
		partitions/  procedures/  triggers/
		types/  views/

It create a generic config file where you just have to define the Oracle
database connection and a shell script called export_schema.sh. The
sources/ directory will contains the Oracle code, the schema/ will
contains the code ported to PostgreSQL. The reports/ directory will
contains the html reports with the migration cost assessment.

Sometime you may want to extract data from an Oracle table but you need a
custom query for that. Not just a "SELECT * FROM table" like Ora2Pg do but
a more complex query. The new directive REPLACE_QUERY allow you to overwrite
the query used by Ora2Pg to extract data. The format is TABLENAME[SQL_QUERY].
If you have multiple table to extract by replacing the Ora2Pg query, you can
define multiple REPLACE_QUERY lines. For example:

    REPLACE_QUERY   EMPLOYEES[SELECT e.id,e.fisrtname,lastname FROM EMPLOYEES e
	      JOIN EMP_UPDT u ON (e.id=u.id AND u.cdate>'2014-08-01 00:00:00')]

Other new features are:

    - Export of declaration of language C function. Previous version was
      not exporting function with no code body like external C function.
    - Export of COMMENT from views.
    - Function to replace some call to SYS_CONTECT(USERENV, ...) by the
      PostgreSQL equivalent.
    - Add POSTGIS_SCHEMA configuration directive to add the dedicated
      PostGis schema into the search_path.
    - Add PG_SUPPORTS_IFEXISTS configuration directive to be able to suppress
      IF EXISTS call in DDL statement generated by Ora2Pg.
    - Triggers are now all excluded/allowed following the table names specified
      in the ALLOW and EXCLUDED directives
    - Allow automatic export of nested tables (TYPE+TABLE+COPY).

One change is not fully backward compatible: Ora2Pg now use UTF8 by default
on both side. On Oracle connection NLS_LANG is set to AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8,
NLS_NCHAR to AL32UTF8. On PostgreSQL side CLIENT_ENCODING to UTF8. For export
that dump to files, Perl binmode is set to utf8. You can always change those
default setting in configuration file, but it is not recommanded.

Here is the full changlog of the release:

    - Fix inline comments into function declaration. Thanks to Marcel Huber
      for the report.
    - Fix case where SELECT ... INTO was wrongly replaced by PERFORM.
    - Fix DECODE() translation. Thanks to Dominique Legendre for the report.
    - Add replacement of SDO_OPERATOR into PostGis relationships.
    - Add replacement of SDO_GEOM spatial function to postgis ST_* functions.
    - Add GEOMETRY_EXTRACT_TYPE configuration directive to specify the geometry
      extracting mode: WKT (default), WKB and INTERNAL.
    - Add a pure Perl library to export SDO_GEOMETRY as a WKT representation.
      This is controlled by a new extraction type INTERNAL to use with the
      GEOMETRY_EXTRACT_TYPE configuration directive.
    - Remove USE_SC40_PACKAGE directive and any reference to this library,
      it is not useful now that we have the INTERNAL geometry extraction mode.
    - Fix replacement of varchar2 in PL/SQL function.
    - Fix bug in type replacement when default values used function.
    - Add export of declaration of language C function. Previous version was
      not exporting function with no code body like external function.
    - Fix create statement in export of view as table. Thanks to ntlis for the
      report.
    - Fix replacement of to_number without format.
    - Add export of COMMENT from VIEWS.
    - Add function to replace some call to SYS_CONTECT(USERENV, ...) by the
      PostgreSQL equivalent.
    - Fix parsing from file of tablespace.
    - Fix wrong alias name in FROM clause when extracting XML data. Thanks
      to Marc Sitges for the report.
    - Fix export of comments in FDW export, might be COMMENT ON FOREIGN TABLE.
      Thanks to David Fetter for the report.

      Ora2Pg process was silently killed by the OOM killer there was no information
      that a failure occurs.

2014 06 02 - v13.0

This major release adds first support to export Oracle Spatial Objects to PostGis
Spatial objects. There's also a new configuration directive to allow logging of
statement failures to prevent Ora2Pg to abort and continue to load valid data. 
The other main feature is the possibility to convert DDL files without needing an
Oracle database connection, until now this was reserved to files containing stored
procedures. There's also several bug fixes.

	- Allow error logging during data import. This feature controlled by the
	  LOG_ON_ERROR directive allow you to not abort the data import process
	  when an error is encountered and to log to a file the COPY or INSERT
	  statement that generate the error. After fixing the statement you will
	  be able to load the missing data. Thanks to menardoram for the feature
	  request.
	- Force export type to be INSERT when COPY is used and a table have a
	  GEOMETRY column. I can not find a solution to export as copy statement
	  for the moment. Thanks to Dominique Legendre and Vincent Picavet for
	  the help.
	- Fix export of user defined type as object. Thanks to Shanshan Wang for
	  the report.
	- Limit look up of objects to the ALLOW or EXCLUDE filter into the SQL
	  query instead of the Perl code to avoid retrieving huge list of objects
	  on such database. Thanks to menardorama for the feature request.
	- Add support to spatial data export in INSERT mode. Still need some work
	  in COPY export mode if possible.
	- Fix query to retrieve SRID that broken with patch on CONVERT_SRID.
	- Fix wrong filter with ALLOW directive when getting list of  partition.
	- Add GRANT export read from an input file.
	- Fix data type conversion when using input file and data type such
	  varchar2(10 BYTE).
	- Add export of comment with TABLE and VIEW exports using an input file.
	- Add extraction of TABLESPACE from an input file.
	- Add support to SEQUENCE extraction from input file.
	- Fix wrong filter with ALLOW directive when exporting partition. The
	  filter was done on partition name instead of table name, that mean
	  that setting ALLOW directive was resulting in no export at all. Thanks
	  to menardorama for the report.
	- Add CONVERT_SRID configuration directive to control the automatic
	  conversion of SRID to standard EPSG using the Oracle SDO function
	  sdo_cs.map_oracle_srid_to_epsg() Oracle function. Thanks to Dominique
	  Legendre for the help.
	- Fix a typo in the create index prefix on partitioned tables. Thanks
	  to menardorama for the patch.
	- Fix non replacement of destination during SHOW_COLUMN and COPY export.
	  Using MODIFY_TYPE was only working in TABLE export.
	- Force pl/sql conversion with TABLE export to replace advanced default
	  values. Fix code TRUNC(SYSDATE, MONTH) in default value and everywhere
	  that should be: date_trunc(month,LOCALTIMESTAMP). Thanks to menardorama
	  for the report.
	- Fix code regarding unique partition index naming. Thanks to menardorama
	  for the report.
	- Add PREFIX_PARTITION configuration directive. When enabled it will force
	  renaming all partition table name with the name of the parent table.
	  Thanks to menardoram for the feature request.
	- Add AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE in configuration file and documentation
	  about this new directive.
	- Add export of SDO_GEOMETRY column type. They are basically exported to
	  the non-constrained "geometry" type with SRID if defined. When the
	  configuration directive AUTODETECT_SPATIAL_TYPE is enable, Ora2Pg will
	  try to autodetect the geometry type, the dimension and the SRID used
	  to set a constrained geometry type. For example, in the first case
	  column shape with Oracle type SDO_GEOMETRY will be converted as:

		shape geometry(GEOMETRY) or shape geometry(GEOMETRY, 4326)

	  and in the second case, with constrained geometry type:

		shape geometry(POLIGONZ, 4326)

	  with a three dimensional polygon. Thanks to Vincent Picavet for the
	  feature request and specification.
	- Add support to spatial index read from file.
	- Add export of Oracle spatial index. For example, index:
		CREATE INDEX cola_spatial_idx ON cola_markets(shape) INDEXTYPE IS MDSYS.SPATIAL_INDEX;
	  will be exported as
		CREATE INDEX cola_spatial_idx ON cola_markets USING GIST(shape);
	  Thanks to Vincent Picavet / Oslandia for the feature request and explanations.
	- Allow TRIGGER export to parse an input file with Oracle DML orders.
	- Add PG_SUPPORTS_CHECKOPTION configuration directive to not remove
	  WITH CHECK OPTION in create view statement. It is supported in 
	  PostgreSQL 9.4.
	- Allow VIEW export to parse an input file with Oracle DML orders.
	- Allow TABLE export to parse an input file with Oracle DML orders.
	- Add SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT configuration directive disabled by default.
	  This is the current behavior of Ora2Pg, it set synchronous_commit
	  to off before data import to PostgreSQL. This is only used when you
	  load data directly to PostgreSQL, the default is off to disable
	  synchronous commit to gain speed at writing data. Some modified or
	  old version of PostgreSQL, like Greenplum, do not have this setting.
	- Add some useful information for Windows user in documentation. Thanks
	  to Roger Park for the report.
	- Fix case when parentheses are omitted in index creation. Thanks to
	  Yuri Ushakov for the report.
	- Fix export type PACKAGE when ALLOW is defined to extract only some
	  packages. Thanks to Maciej Bak for the report.
	- Fix INSERT export where backslash should be escaped and single be
	  doubled in standard conforming string notation. Thanks to Yuri
	  Ushakov for the report.
	- Add important note about LONGREADLEN and DATA_LIMIT that could need
	  to be adjusted to avoid out of memory. Thanks to Mike Kienenberger
	  for the patch.
	- Fix case sensitivity issue with export of comment on column. Thanks
	  to Pierre Crumeyrolle for the report.
	- Fix export of RAW data in COPY mode, was missing a backslash. Thanks
	  to jwiechmann for the report.
	- Fix RAW data export in COPY and INSERT mode, RAW data type is returned
	  in hex by DBD::Oracle. Thanks to jwiechmann for the report.
	- Fix one release 8i condition.
	- Fix inexistent column USE_NO_INDEX with Oracle 8i and MVIEW export.
	- Enclose call to utf8::encode and utf8::valid into eval.
	- Fix export of constraint with Oracle 8i release.
	- Fix unrecognized fatal error with 8i database. Thanks to UnvorherSeba
	  for the patch.
	- Revert change level of error from fatal to error, when querying
	  materialized view.
	- Change level of error from fatal to error, when querying materialized
	  view.

2014 01 28 - v12.1

This is a maintenance release with some minor bug fixes and a new configuration
directive, INDEXES_SUFFIX, to allow appending a suffix to indexes names.

	- Fix example given for the WHERE configuration directive. Thanks to
	  Bob Treumann for the report.
	- Add INDEXES_SUFFIX configuration option to allow append a suffix to
	  indexes names.
	- Replace special charater ^M by \r as they are not supported by git.
	- Fix IF EXISTS in alter table of sub _drop_foreign_keys. Thanks to
	  Francis Corriveau for the patch.
	- Fix isolation level when exporting data. Thanks to Ludovic Penet for
	  the report.
	- Fix regression when ora2pg tries to create foreign keys on tables or
	  to tables that are not selected for export. Thanks to Ludovic Penet.
	- Add information about backslashed comma into directive MODIFY_TYPE
	  into Makefile.PL.

	  Thanks to Guillaume Lelarge for the report.
	- Fix export of materialized views when PG_SUPPORTS_MVIEW is disabled.
	  Thanks to Christian Bjornbak for the report.
	- Update copyright.

2013 05 27 - v11.3

This release fixes several major issues on migration cost assessment, especialy
with stored procedures with lot of lines or if you have lot of comments in that
code. You may want to run your database evaluation again as the estimated times
can be up to tree time lower on huge PL/SQL code. 

	- Add full details about PL/SQL evaluation by ora2pg when --estimate_cost
	  or ESTIMATE_COST is enable. This will display cost units per keywords
	  detected in the function/package code.

UPGRADE: please reinstall all as most of the files have changed.

2013 04 07 - v11.1

This release adds partition data speed improvement by exporting data directly
from and into the destination partitioned table. There's also some bug fix on
RAW or LONG RAW data export and PL/SQL to PL/PGSQL code rewrite.

	- Adjust cost assessment for indexes, tables and tables partition.
	- Add comment to report of index partition about local index only.
	- Fix position of TRUNCATE TABLE in output file.
	- Fix export of data from RAW or LONG RAW columns, they was exported
	  as hex string. Now data are converted using utl_raw.cast_to_varchar2()
	  function before being escaped for insert into a bytea. Thanks to Alex
	  Delianis for the report.
	- Fix issue with Oracle TIMESTAMP(0) data export that add a single
	  ending point, ex: "2008-08-09 00:00:00.", this ending character is
	  now removed by format_data_type(). Thanks to Pierre-Marie Petit for
	  the report.
	- Fix typo on MODIFY_STRUCT description.
	- Force DEBUG to off in default configuration file.
	- Change range PARTITION operators in the check conditions, >= and <
	  replaced by > and <=, corresponding to Oracle VALUES LESS THAN.
	- Add ALLOW_PARTITION to limit data export to a list of partition name.
	- PLSQL: Fix wrong replacement of SELECT by PERFORM during VIEW export.
	- Partitioned tables data is now imported directly into the destination
	  tables instead of inserted into the main table and dispatched by the
	  trigger. Ora2Pg will automatically detect the in/out table partition,
	  there's nothing to configure.
	- PL/SQL: Do not allow decode() rewrite by case/when/else when there
	  is a function call in it.
	- Fix Error when Compress::Zlib is not installed, this module is not
	  mandatory.

UPGRADE: please reinstall all as all files have changed.

2013 03 24 - v11.0

This is a new major release because it adds support to multiprocessing to export
data in parallel mode, this allow to improve speed during data import by more
than ten times. This multiprocessiing capabilities allow Ora2Pg to be closer than
the speed of any ETL. To compare speed or allow using Kettle for data import,
there's now a new export type to obtain Kettle XML transformation files. This
release adds also lot of work on speed improvement to scan Oracle database with
huge number of object.

	- Add documentation about JOBS, ORACLE_COPIES, DEFINED_PK configuration
	  directive and informations about KETTLE export type.
	- Add KETTLE export type to generate XML transformation file definition
	  for Penthatlo Data Integrator (Kettle). Thanks to Marc Cousin for the
	  work. Example of use:
		ora2pg -c ora2pg.conf -t KETTLE -j 12 -J 4 -o loaddata.sh
	- Fix major bug in export of auto generated named constraint. Thanks to
	  mrojasaquino fot the report.

	  export type.
	- Fix progressbar output when ora2pg is interrupted by ctrl+c.
	- Add JOBS, ORACLE_COPIES and DEFINED_PK directives to configuration file.
	  JOBS replacing THREAD_COUNT but backward compatibility is preserve.
	- Add 3 new command line options, -j | --jobs and -J | --copies, used to
	  set the number of connection to PostgreSQL and Oracle for parallel
	  processing. The third, -L | --limit is used to change DATA_LIMIT at
	  command line.
	- Add multiprocess support on data export. With the help of Thomas Ogrisegg.
	- Add more schema in SYSUSERS that should not be exported.
	- Add full detailed information about SYNONYM in SHOW_REPORT.
	- Add MODIFY_TYPE configuration directive to allow some table/column
	  type to be changed on PostgreSQL side during the export.
	- Fix objects type count in progressbar of SHOW_REPORT.
	- Restrict table and index in SHOW_REPORT to the tables defined in ALLOW
	  and EXCLUDE directives.

2012 12 12 - v10.0

This is the first version of Ora2Pg 10.x series, that is a major release.
Overall numerous improvements and bugs fixes there's now a new export type:
SHOW_REPORT that will output a report of all objects contained in your Oracle
database and some comments on how they will be exported. With this report you
can use a new directive ESTIMATE_COST to ask to Ora2Pg to evaluate the database
migration cost in terms of man days. There's also an other new configuration
directive EXTERNAL_TO_FDW, disable by default, to permit the export of all
Oracle external tables as file_fdw foreign tables.

The database content report and the migration cost estimation is a work in
progress so all feedback on these new features are welcome. Here is the complete
changelog:

	- Update documentation about ora2pg usage and new feature.
	- Fix quote escaping on table comments. Thanks to Sebastian Fischer.
	- Fix some other issues with 8i databases, added database version auto-
	  detection to avoid printinf warning. Thanks to Sebastian Fischer for
	  the help.
	- Allow null value in BFILE to the oar2pg_get_bfilename().
	- Update documentation about BFILE export.
	- Add drop function ora2pg_get_bfilename() when necessary.
	- Add support to BFILE external path export by creating a function
	  ora2pg_get_bfilename( p_bfile IN BFILE ) to retrieve path from BFILE.
	  BFILE will be exported as text field with the full path to the file as
	  value. Note that this is the first time that Ora2Pg need write access
	  to the Oracle database, if you do not have BFILE or you have set the
	  corresponding PostgreSQL type asd bytea (the default) the function
	  will not be created.
	- Fix a performance issue when extracting BLOB with a LongReadLen upper
	  than 1MB.
	- Fix priviledge on schema created from Oracle package body. Thanks to
	  Dominique Legendre for the report.

	  Thanks to Sriram Chandrasekaran fot the feature request.
	- PLSQL: Add replacement of Oracle decode() by PostgreSQL CASE/THEN/ELSE.
	  Thanks to Sriram Chandrasekaran fot the feature request.
	  Note that this two replacement was not implemented because they could
	  break the code if there's complex subqueries inside their declaration.
	  This is why you can enable it by setting ALLOW_CODE_BREAK to 1 (new).
	  In later release this directive will be enable by default.
	- Add output ordering on some object name so that results between two
	  runs can be compared. Thanks to Henk Enting for the patch.
	- Fix misshandling of all cases of RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR rewrite into
	  RAISE EXCEPTION concatenations. Thanks to Krasi Zlatev for the report.

UPGRADE: only Ora2Pg.pm and Ora2Pg/PSQL.pm have changed so you can just override them
if you dont want to reinstall all.

2011 10 13 - 8.8

	- Before that release when you upgraded Ora2Pg using Makefile, the old
	  ora2pg.conf was renamed as ora2pg.old. This can lead to lost previous
	  configuration, the old ora2pg.conf is now untouched and the new one is
	  installed as ora2pg.conf.new.
	- Renamed ora2pg.pl into ora2pg_pl in the package before installation
	  to avoid the copy of the perl script into the site Perl install dir.
	  It is still installed as ora2pg in /usr/local/bin by default.
	- Fix errors that appeared to be due to no quoting on the field names
	  when ORA_SENSITIVE is enabled. Thank to Sam Nelson for the patch.
	- Limit case sensitivity on check constraints to column names only,
	  before that if there was a value between double quote into the check
	  constraint, it was wrongly changed to lower case.
	- Fix broken case sensitivity at data export when disabling/enabling
	  triggers and truncating tables with copy or insert statement.
	- Change Ora2Pg version in packaging files that was still in 8.5.

UPGRADE: only Ora2Pg.pm have changed so you can just override it.

2011 09 07 - 8.7

	- The escape_bytea() function has been rewritten using a prebuild array
	  to gain twice of performances. Thanks to Marc Cousin from Dalibo for
	  the patch.
	- Improve speed of bulkload data by disabling autocommit by issuing a
	  BEGIN at the start and COMMIT at the end.
	- Add multi-threading support. It is only used to do the escaping to
	  convert LOBs to byteas, as it is very cpu hungry. There's a lot of
	  CPU-waste here. The threads number is controlled by a new configuration
	  directive: THREAD_COUNT. Putting 6 threads will only triple your
	  throughput, if your machine has enough cores. If zero (default value),
	  do not use threads, do not waste CPU, but be slower with bytea.
	  Performance seems to peak at 5 threads, if you have enough cores, and
	  triples throughput on tables having LOB. Another important thing:
	  because of the way threading works in perl, threads consume a lot of
	  memory. Put a low (5000 for instance) DATA_LIMIT if you activate
	  threading. Many thanks to Marc Cousin for this great patch.
	- Fix standard_conforming_string usage on export as INSERT statement.
	- Fix an issue with importing Oracle NULL character (\0 or char(0)) with
	  bytea and character data with UTF8 encoding. Now whatever is the data
	  type or the encoding, this character is simply removed to prevent the
	  well known 'ERROR: invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0x00.'
	  Thanks to Jean-Paul Argudo from Dalibo for the report.
	- Fix an incorrect syntax for "for each statement" triggers.
	  Thanks to Henk Enting for the report.
	- Add comment at end of line to signal on which cursor the replacement
	  on " EXIT WHEN (...)%NOTFOUND " is done. This will return something 
	  like "IF NOT FOUND THEN EXIT; END IF; -- apply on $1". Thanks to
	  jehan Guillaume De Rorthais from Dalibo for the report this help a lot
	  during Pl/Pgsql code review.
	- Fix table/column name replacement on constraint creation and dropping
	  when REPLACE_TABLES/REPLACE_COLS is set during DATA/COPY export.
	- Fix table/column name replacement on indexes creation and dropping
	  when REPLACE_TABLES/REPLACE_COLS is set during DATA/COPY export.
	- Remove unused table name parameter in _drop_indexes() function.
	- Add support to REPLACE_TABLES/REPLACE_COLS during schema export.
	  Before this release those replacements were only applied to DATA or
	  COPY export. You can now use it in schema export, it will replace
	  table and/or column names in the TABLE/INDEX/CONSTRAINT schema export.
	  MODIFY_STRUCT is still limited to DATA or COPY export as it have no
	  sense outside this export. Unfortunately those replacements can not be
	  done easilly in other export type like TRIGGER, FUNCTION, etc. so you
	  must still edit this code by hand.
	- Use the bundled Perl Config module to detect if Perl is compiled with
	  useithread. This mean that the old local defined %Config hash has been
	  replaced by %AConfig.
	- SKIP indices is now obsolete and must be replaced with SKIP indexes.
	  backward compatibility is preserved.
	- The file generated when FILE_PER_INDEX is activated has been renamed
	  into INDEXES_... instead of INDICES_...
	- Add a warning on tablespace export when Oracle user is not a dba.
	- Fix fatal error when dumping to one file per function with double
	  directory output.
	- Fix double print of FATAL messages and dirty database disconnect on
	  fatal errors.
	- Add setting of client_encoding into each export type as defined in
	  the configuration file.
	- Update web site documentation.

UPGRADE: Ora2Pg.pm, Ora2Pg/PGSQL.pm and ora2pg have changed so they must be
overwritten.  There's also changes in the configuration file and documentation
has changed as well. Backward compatibility is fully preserved.


2011 07 07 - 8.6

	- Remove "use strict" from head of Ora2Pg.pm that breaks view export.
	  This is usually removed before public release, but not this time.
	  Thanks to Jehan Guillaume de Rorthais from Dalibo for the report.
	- Add a new configuration directive called COMPILE_SCHEMA that force
	  Oracle to compile the PL/SQL before code extraction to validate
	  code that was invalidate for any reason before. If you set it to 1,
	  you will force compiling of the user session schema, but you can
	  specify the name of the schema to compile as the value too. Thanks
	  to Jean-Paul Argudo from Dalibo for the solution.
	- Add new configuration directive EXPORT_INVALID to allow export of all
	  PL/SQL code even if it is marked as invalid status. The 'VALID' or 
	  'INVALID' status applies to functions, procedures, packages and user
	  defined types.
	- Excluded from export all tables, types, views, functions and packages
	  that contains a $ character. Most of the time they don't need to be
	  exported.
	- PLSQL: add automatic conversion of Oracle SYS_REFURSOR as PostgreSQL
	  REFCURSOR.
	- Rewrite entirely the parser of DBMS_OUTPUT du to concatenation errors.
	- PLSQL: add automatic replacement of some Oracle exception errors:
          INVALID_CURSOR=>INVALID_CURSOR_STATE, ZERO_DIVIDE=>DIVISION_BY_ZERO,
          STORAGE_ERROR=>OUT_OF_MEMORY.

UPGRADE: Ora2Pg.pm and Ora2Pg/PGSQL.pm have changed so they must be overwritten.
There's also changes in the configuration file and documentation has changed as
well. Backward compatibility is fully preserved.


2011 07 01 - 8.5

	- When FILE_PER_FUNCTION is activated and export type is PACKAGE, Ora2Pg
	  will now save all functions/procedures of a package body into a
	  directory named as the package name and into different files. This
	  will allow to load each function separatly or load them all with the
	  OUTPUT SQL script generated by Ora2Pg.
	- Fix Oracle package body parsing failure when a procedure is declared
	  inside an other.
	- Add new configuration options FILE_PER_CONSTRAINT and FILE_PER_INDEX
	  to generate three files during the schema extraction. One for the
	  'CREATE TABLE' statements, one for the constraints (primary keys,
	  foreign keys, etc.) and the last one for indices. Thanks to Daniel
	  Scott for the feature request.
	- Allow to process PL/SQL Oracle code from file instead of a database
	  to apply Ora2Pg code conversion. Thank to Mindy Markowitz for the
	  feature request. See -i or --input_file command line option to ora2pg
	  perl script or INPUT_FILE new configuration option.
	- Add new configuration directive STANDARD_CONFORMING_STRINGS that is
	  used only during DATA export type to build INSERT statements. This
	  should avoid 'WARNING:  nonstandard use of \\ in a string literal'.
	  Please check that this behavior is backward compatible with your
	  PostgreSQL usage as this is enabled by default now.

UPGRADE: The new features has changed Ora2Pg.pm and ora2pg.pl so that they must
be overwritten. There's also changes in the configuration file and documentation
has changed as well. Take care of backward compatibility with escaped strings in
DATA export type and the new behavior on PACKAGE export. 

2011 06 07 - 8.4

	- Moves Ora2Pg to SourceForge.net.
	- Fix an issue on setting owner in "ALTER SEQUENCE ... SET OWNER TO".
	  Thanks to Herve Girres for the report.
	- Bugfix on lower case convertion for check constraints extraction.
	  Thanks to Alexander Korotkov for the patch.

UPGRADE: There's no new functionality, this is a bug fix release.

2011 05 11 - 8.3

	- Fix issue on inherited user defined types converted to inherited tables.
	  Add comment on unsupported inherited type in PostgreSQL too. Thanks to
	  Mathieu Wingel for the report.
	- Fix issue on column default values. Oracle all this kind of strange
	  syntax: counter NUMBER(4) default '' not null, that was translated to
	  counter smallint DEFAULT '' by Ora2Pg. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel this is
	  now rewritten as DEFAULT NOT NULL.
	- Fix case sensitivity on create view when there was double quote on the
	  column name statement part. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel or the report.
	- Fix bad patch applied on column name case sensitivity issue during check
	  constraint export. Thanks to Philippe Rimbault for the report.
	- Fix bug on package export introduced into version v8.2. The issue was
	  related to end of package procedure detection. hanks to Mathieu Wingel
	  or the report.

UPGRADE: There's no new functionality, this is a bug fix release and every one
should upgrade to it.


2011 05 01 - 8.2

	- PLSQL: automatic replacement of EXIT WHEN cursor%NOTFOUND; by Pg
	  synthax: IF NOT FOUND THEN EXIT; END IF;. Works with additional
	  condition too.
	- PLSQL: Automatic replacement of SQL%NOTFOUND by NOT FOUND.
	- PLSQL: Add detection of TOO_MANY_ROW to NO_DATA_FOUND to add STRICT.
	- Completely rewrite the parsing of Oracle package body to handle all
	  cases and especially prodedure declared into an other procedure.
	  Those procedure are renamed INTERNAL_FUNCTION and must be rewritten.
	- Fix type usage of ora2pg Perl script.
	- Add a new directive FORCE_OWNER. By default the owner of the database
	  objects is the one you're using to connect to PostgreSQL. If you use
	  an other user (postgres for exemple) you can force Ora2Pg to set the
	  object owner to be the one used in the Oracle database by setting the
	  directive to 1, or to a completely different username by setting the
	  directive value to that username. Thanks to Herve Girres from Meteo
	  France for the suggestion and patch.
	- Add --forceowner or -f command line option to ora2pg program.
	- Add SHOW_ENCODING extract type to return the Oracle session encoding.
	  For example it can return: NLS_LANG AMERICAN_AMERICA.AL32UTF8 
	- Remove SYS_EXTRACT_UTC from index creation as Pg always stores them
	  in UTC. Thanks to Daniel Scott for the patch.
	- In PLSQL code SYS_EXTRACT_UTC is replaced by the Pg syntaxe:
	  field AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'.
	- Fix a pending problem with "Wide character in print at" on COPY mode.
	  Thanks to Bernd Helmle from Credativ GmbH for the patch.
	- PLSQL: Add automatic rewrite of FOR ... IN REVERSE ... into Pg synthax
	- Fix column name case sensitivity issue during check constraint export.
	  Thanks to Daniel Berger for the report.
	- Remove the possibility to add comment after a configuration directive
	  it may not be used and it was generating an issue with the passwords
	  configuration directives for examples. Thanks to Daniel Berger for the
	  report.
	- Complete rewrite of user defined type extraction. Add support of inherited
	  type using Oracle UNDER keyword as well as better support to custom type
	  with BODY. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel for the report.
	- Fix case sensitivity on user defined types. Thanks to Mathieu Wingel for
	  the report.

UPGRADE: All files have changed so you need a fresh install/upgrade.
Previous release used to remove any string starting from a # in the config file,
this was to allow comments after a configuration directive. This possibility
have been removed in this release so you can no more add comments after a
configuration directive.


2011 03 28 - 8.1

	- Prevent Ora2PG to export twice datas when using FILE_PER_TABLE and
	  the data output file exist. This is useful in case of export failure
	  and you don't want to export all data again. This also mean that if
	  you want to get new data you have to remove the old files before.
	- Fix parsing of procedure/function into pl/sql Oracle package.
	- Fix bug in IS NULL/IS NOT NULL replacement. Thanks to Jean-Paul Argudo
	  from Dalibo for the report.
	- Add CREATE OR REPLACE on RULE creation.
	- Add DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS before trigger creation.
	- Replace Oracle date "0000-00-00" by NULL.

	  array. Thank to Jean-Paul Argudo from Dalibo for the patch.
	- Fix multiple double quote in name of create index definition.
	- Apply excluded and limited table to tablespace extraction.
	- Fix function and procedure detection/parsing on package content.
	- Fix schema prefix in function name declaration in package export. 
	- PLSQL: Replace some way of extracting date part of a date :
	  TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(...)) rewritten into TO_CHAR(...)::integer when
	  TO_NUMBER just have one argument.
	- Fix Makefile.pl error when trying to modify file ora2pg now renamed
	  into ora2pg.pl
	- Add 3 new export types SHOW_SCHEMA, SHOW_TABLE and SHOW_COLUMN. Those
	  new extraction keyword are use to only display the requested information
	  and exit. This allow you to quickly know on what you are going to work.
	  The SHOW_COLUMN allow a new ora2pg command line option: '--xtable relname'
	  or '-x relname' to limit the displayed information to the given table.
	- Add type replacement for BINARY_INTEGER and PLS_INTEGER as integer.

UPGRADE: Please make a full upgrade asap to this release.

2011 03 15 - 8.0

	- Remove PG_SUPPORT_ROLES, now Ora2Pg assumes the PostgreSQL database
	  destination support it (Pg > v8.1).
	- Complete rewrite of the GRANT (user/role/grant) export type. It now
	  should be only related to the current Oracle database. Note that do
	  not try to import rights asis as you may import have errors or worse
	  miss handling of the rights! Just remember that for example in Oracle
	  a schema is nothing else than a user so it must not be imported like
	  this.
	- Fix multiple errors in partitionning definition. Thank to Reto Buchli
	  for the report.
	- PLSQL: reordering cursor Oracle declaration "DECLARE CURSOR name" into
	  "DECLARE name CURSOR". Thank to Reto Buchli (WSL IT) for the report.

	  Patino for the fix.
	- Fix release version into Ora2Pg.pm and PLSQL.pm, was still in 6.5.
	- Fix direct data export/import using DBD::Pg. Thanks to Laurent Renard
	  from Cap Gemini for the report.
	- Fix drop/create contraints and index during direct data export/import

2010 11 23 - 7.0

	- Rename ora2pg perl script into ora2pg.pl in sources because Windows
	  users can't extract the tarball. During install it is renamed into
	  ora2pg. Thanks to Andrew Marlow for the report.
	- Fix doinst.sh for SlackWare Slackbuid packaging.
	- The DEFER_FKEY configuration directive has been fixed as it only

	  as DEFERRABLE or it also will not works. Thanks to Igor Gelman for the
	  report.
	- Add DROP_FKEY configuration directive to force deletion of foreign keys
	  before the import and recreate them and the end of the import. This may
	  help if DEFER_FKEY not works for you.

	  except the automatic index (primary keys) before data import and to
	  recreate them at end. This can be used to gain speed during import.
	- Add TSMSYS, FLOWS_020100 and FLOWS_FILES to the owners exclude list.
	  This concern the SRS$ table and all tables begining with 'WWV_FLOW_'
	- Change the way DATA_LIMIT is working. It must be used now to set the

	- Improve data export speed by 6! The data export code has been entierly
	  rewritten and the speed gain is really fun.
	- Add OUTPUT_DIR configuration directive to set a base directory where all
	  dumped files must be written. Default: current directory.
	- Change value of default numeric(x) type from float to bigint and change

UPGRADE: Just override Ora2Pg.pm

2010 06 15 - 6.2

	- Change default transaction isolation level from READ ONLY to
	  SERIALIZABLE to ensure consistency during data export. Thanks to
	  Hans-Jürgen Schönig from postgresql-support.de
	- Add the TRANSACTION configuration directive to allow overriding of
	  the isolation level. Value can be readonly, readwrite, committed and
	  serializable. The last is the default.

2010 05 07 - 6.1

	- Fix error on partition export following schema definition.
	- Add first support to export Oracle user defined types.

	- Publish a dedicated site to Ora2Pg at http://ora2pg.darold.net/
	- Add export of Oracle table partitoning. See export type PARTITION.
	- Add command line arguments to perl script ora2pg. See --help for a
	  full listing of these option. The most interesting is --type to change
	  the export type directly at command execution without needing to edit
	  the configuration file, --plsql to directly enable PLSQL to PLPSQL
	  code conversion and --source, --user --password to set Oracle data
	  source. There's also --namespace to set the Oracle schema.
	- Create all file for standard Perl module install. Install is now done
	  with: perl Makefile.PL && make && make install
	- Move Ora2Pg license from Perl Artistics to GPLv3.

	- Fix debug filename output on multiple export file. Thanks to Leo
	Mannhart for the report.

2009 07 07 - version 5.3

	- Fix wrong escaping of data named as column during view export. Thank
	to Andrea Agosti for the patch.
	- Allow export of datas into one file per table. See FILE_PER_TABLE
	configuration directive. Thanks to Alexandre - Aldeia Digital for the
	idea.

	keep_pkeys_name and so prevent use of KEEP_PKEY_NAMES in configuration.
	Thanks to Olivier Mazain for the report.
	- Configuration file directives are now case insensitive.
	- Force $type parameter given to _sql_type() to be uppercase in that
	methode instead of during function call. Thanks to Ali Pouya for the
	report.
	- Modify ora2pg.pl to remove the obsolete call to export_data(). Use
	only export_schema() now.
	- Modify ora2pg.pl to simplify it. Reading configuration is now done
	internally by Ora2Pg.pm as well as all other initialization process.
	You can always overwrite all configuration options into call to new
	Ora2Pg(). Now ora2pg.pl can be as simple as:

		use Ora2Pg;
		my $schema = new Ora2Pg('config' => "/etc/ora2pg.conf");
		$schema->export_schema();
		exit(0);

	This will be less confusing. You can upgrade Ora2Pg.pm without carring
	about that, backward compatibility with previous version is preserved.
	- Review entire documentation with the great help of Ali Pouya.
	- Add type BOOLEAN converted to boolean.
	- PG_SUPPORTS_INOUT is now enabled by default in the configuration file

	     by the PLPGSQL equivalent: RAISE NOTICE
	    .Rewrite function/procedure/package convertion functions.
	This Oracle SQL converter for function/procedure/package is now only
	applied if the configuration directive PLSQL_PGSQL is enable, else
	these Oracle code are exported as is. Thanks to Ali Pouya for the help.

	- Reserved call to sql transaction only for DATA export type. Others
	export type now use \set ON_ERROR_STOP ON. Thanks to Ali Pouya.
	- Fix tablespace creation into schema (missing search_path). Thanks to
	Olivier Mazain.
	- Fix the type returned by the _sql_type() method in the case of a
	numeric with null len and pg_numeric_type is set. Thanks to Ali Pouya.
	- Change function body delimiter to $body$ to allow use of $$ into the
	body as quote replacement. Thanks to Ali Pouya.
	- Fix returns type from function. If multiple OUT parameters: RECORD,
	if only one OUT parameter, return his type. If no out parameter: return
	VOID. Thanks to Ali Pouya.
	- Fix export DATA when the name of a column in the table match COMMENT,
	AUDIT or any other defined reserved words. These reserved words are
	defined in a new configuration variable ORA_RESERVED_WORDS. It accept

	the report.
	- Fix configuration parser that omit custom SYSUSERS definition.

	- Add the capability to extract data from view as if it was a table.
	  This is usefull if you want to export/import data from an Oracle
	  view into a Pg table. There's nothing special to do, just to give
	  the view name into the TABLES configuration directive and set TYPE
	  to DATA or COPY. If views are not specified in the TABLES directive
	  there's not view export but only table data.
	- Add capability to extract views structure as table schema. There's
	  nothing special to do, just to give the view name into the TABLES
	  configuration directive and set TYPE to TABLE. This will not extract
