Ora2Pg is a tool used to migrate an Oracle database to a PostgreSQL compatible
schema. It connects your Oracle database, scan it automaticaly and extracts its
structure or data, it then generates SQL scripts that you can load into your
PostgreSQL database. 

Ora2Pg can be used from reverse engineering Oracle database to huge enterprise
database migration or simply to replicate some Oracle data into a PostgreSQL
database. It is really easy to used and doesn't need any Oracle database
knowledge than providing the parameters needed to connect to the Oracle
database. 

You need a modern Perl distribution (perl 5.6 or more), the DBI and DBD::Oracle
Perl modules to be installed. These are used to connect to the Oracle database.
To install DBD::Oracle and have it working you need to have the Oracle client
libraries installed and the ORACLE_HOME environment variable must be defined.

Note that the Oracle and the PostgreSQL databases doesn't need to be on the
host running Ora2Pg but this host must have at least the Oracle client libraries
installed and the PostgreSQL client if you want to use psql or DBD::Pg to import
data.
